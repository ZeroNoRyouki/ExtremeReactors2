If no fuel properties are specified for new fuels reactants, the default ones (Yellorium) are used.

You will use it, for example, to craft Blutonium from Cyanite (check the recipe in JEI).\r\nThe Reprocessor is a 3x3x7 (x/z/y, external dimensions) multiblock build using Reprocessor Casing blocks for the frame or faces. Reprocessor Glass blocks can be used instead of Casing on the faces. You need one (and only one) of each of the other Reprocessor parts (Controller, Collector, Waste Injector, Fluid Injector, Output Port, Power Port). The Waste Inject goes in the top face, the Collector on the bottom face. The other ones can go on any vertical face.\r\nThe Reprocessor recipes use an item and a fluid to craft another item.
